# importing math functions

import math

# sqrt of a number
a = math.sqrt(25)

# floor
# floating value round off to the nearest lower integer
b = math.floor(3.7)

# ceil
# floating value round off to the nearest upper integer
c = math.ceil(3.7)

# pow
# power of a number
d = math.pow(2, 3)

# some constants as well

print(math.pi)

# in this way we can access

# import specific function
# from math sqrt
# we can also do, import math as m
# then we can access m.sqrt, m.floor, etc.
